# README

Welcome to Gardening by ZIP Code!

I decided to build something that's been on my mind for years; a tool that helps gardeners and homeowners manage all of the plants they have based on where they live.

* How to run the test suite: TBD

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.): TBD

* Deployment instructions: TBD
